# History

This project was developed with Dominic Wieser as project leader at CodeFactory in 2018. 
The login system together with parts of the Javascript code were developed by me. Isabel together with Dominic Klenk were working on the layout, graphics and forms. 

# Description and User Story

The purpose was to use Angular and Firebase to make a homepage where a supposed company called BIM could present courses which were stored in the Firebase database. The login system was JavaScript based and the passwords were stored as hashes. The logged in and registered user could book courses. 


# BimProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
